Below is the information you really need for data-modeling: **who will ask for what, when, and how often.** I’m not giving schemas—just the access patterns that drive them.

## 1 .  Services that will read your data

| Consumer                         | Primary job                                                         | Typical call frequency                      | Freshness SLA                                   | “Shape” of each query                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dispatcher UI**                | Show every driver’s *current* trip (or “none”) so ops can intervene | High (100–1 000 r/s bursts as maps refresh) | ≤ 200 ms, must be accurate within a few seconds | `GET /drivers/{driverId}/active-trip` → at most one row                 |
| **Rider / Driver apps**          | History screens (last 90 days)                                      | Medium (page loads)                         | 120 ms for first page                           | `GET /riders/{riderId}/trips?from…&to…&page=` → paginated, newest-first |
| **Billing service**              | Compute fare when ride ends                                         | 1 per completed ride                        | Strong (cannot miss or double-bill)             | `GET /trips/{tripId}/snapshot` (immutable blob)                         |
| **Surge-pricing engine**         | Heat-map of completed rides per 1 km² / 15 min bucket               | Cron every minute                           | May lag up to 2 min                             | `GET /stats/{cityId}?bucket=2025-06-16T14:00Z` → small aggregate        |
| **Fraud / Analytics batch jobs** | Ad-hoc scan of raw events to detect anomalies                       | Nightly                                     | Hours                                           | Spark/Presto job that reads **all** events for previous 24 h            |

## 2 .  How they connect in a real system

### 2.1  High-volume, interactive reads

Dispatcher UI & mobile apps **call your REST API** (the Spring service) because:

* They need auth tokens, rate-limiting, and JSON—things easier to expose via HTTP than direct Cassandra access.
* You can shape the response (e.g., flatten clustering keys) and hide internal layout.

### 2.2  Strong-consistency reads

Billing service can take either path:

1. **REST call to you** → your code does one `SELECT …` at `LOCAL_QUORUM`.
2. **Direct Cassandra session** (common in micro-service shops) if billing is latency-sensitive and you want to skip an HTTP hop.

Either way, it always reads the *snapshot* table that you write at `LOCAL_QUORUM`.

### 2.3  Large analytics scans

Batch jobs go **straight to Cassandra** (or to a CDC/S3 export) so they don’t overwhelm your service tier.

### 2.4  Streaming fan-out (optional)

If you later add Kafka, the Trip-Event service would *publish* each event after the write.
Consumers that need event-driven behaviour (surge engine, fraud detector) subscribe to the topic instead of polling.

## 3 .  Concrete query patterns you must support

| Pattern ID                  | Query description                                                                   | Drive for table design                                                                |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Q1 – Active-trip lookup** | “`SELECT … WHERE driver_id = ?` LIMIT 1”                                            | Partition by `driverId`, cluster on `tripState` or `ts DESC`, TTL rows after `ENDED`. |
| **Q2 – Rider history**      | “`SELECT … WHERE rider_id = ? AND trip_bucket = ? ORDER BY ts DESC LIMIT 20`”       | Bucketing (`yyyyMM`) in PK to avoid hot partitions; secondary index not required.     |
| **Q3 – Trip timeline**      | “`SELECT * FROM trip_events WHERE trip_id = ? ORDER BY ts`”                         | Partition by `tripId`; clustering on `ts`.                                            |
| **Q4 – Surge heat-map**     | “`SELECT count FROM trip_counts WHERE city_id = ? AND time_bucket BETWEEN ? AND ?`” | Pre-aggregated table keyed `(cityId, timeBucket, gridId)`; write ONE is fine.         |
| **Q5 – Immutable snapshot** | “`SELECT json_blob FROM trip_snapshot WHERE trip_id = ?`”                           | Single wide row keyed by `tripId`; written once, never updated.                       |

These five cover every current requirement we’ve discussed.

## 4 .  Do you already have enough information?

* Yes—everything above plus the **user-stories list** we sketched earlier (active lookup, history paging, heat-map, snapshot) is what you need to design partitions, clustering columns, and TTLs.
* If any new consumer appears, ask them **“exactly how will you query?”**; if the pattern isn’t covered by Q1–Q5, you may add another table or a Materialized View. In Cassandra **denormalising per-query is normal**.

---

## 5 .  Next step for you

1. Map each pattern (Q1–Q5) to a table outline on paper.
2. Double-check that each SELECT touches **one** partition and returns data in the order needed (or with `LIMIT`).
3. Add TTL, consistency level, and secondary indexes only if the pattern demands them.
4. When you’re happy, code the entities/repositories and shoot them over—I’ll review partition-size estimates and edge-cases.

That’s the whole “how they’ll read” picture; the table design is now in your hands.
